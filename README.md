# Awesome Astronomy

A list of awesome astronomy projects. [Please contribute with pull requests!](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Awesome Datasets

- [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org/user_guide/datasets.html) - Tools for downloading and working with astronomical data sets, including SDSS spectra, SDSS photometry, SDSS DR7 Quasar Catalog, SDSS Imaging, Stripe 82 time domain, NASA Sloan Atlas, RR Lyrae templates, LINEAR light curves, LIGO data, and WMAP.

## Awesome Codes

### General Frameworks

- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) - Aims to be the single core package for Astronomy in Python. Includes FITS data structures, flexible tables with even more flexible I/O, units, coordinates (including WCS), statistical modelling, and cosmology routines. [python]

### Statistics

- [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org) - A Python package for machine learning and data mining. Includes density estimation, supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, time series analysis, regression and classification. Associated with the book *Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy* by Zeljko Ivezic, Andrew Connolly, Jacob VanderPlas, and Alex Gray. [python]
- [Emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/) - Seriously kick-ass MCMC. Emcee is an MIT licensed pure-Python implementation of [Goodman & Weareâ€™s Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Ensemble sampler](http://msp.berkeley.edu/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml) [python]

### Visualization

- [AplPy](http://aplpy.github.io) - a Python module aimed at producing publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data in FITS format. The module uses Matplotlib, a powerful and interactive plotting package. It is capable of creating output files in several graphical formats, including EPS, PDF, PS, PNG, and SVG. [python]
