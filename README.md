## Awesome Codes

### General Frameworks

- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) - Aims to be the single core package for Astronomy in Python. Includes FITS data structures, flexible tables with even more flexible I/O, units, coordinates (including WCS), statistical modelling, and cosmology routines. [python]

### Statistics

- [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org) - A Python package for machine learning and data mining. Includes density estimation, supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, time series analysis, regression and classification. Associated with the book *Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy* by Zeljko Ivezic, Andrew Connolly, Jacob VanderPlas, and Alex Gray. [python]

### Visualization

- [AplPy](http://aplpy.github.io) - a Python module aimed at producing publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data in FITS format. The module uses Matplotlib, a powerful and interactive plotting package. It is capable of creating output files in several graphical formats, including EPS, PDF, PS, PNG, and SVG. [python]
